  <h1 align="center">MNIST dataset predictions using KNN and SVM</h1>

  <p align="center">
This project involves training and testing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms on the MNIST database. Both programs aim to accurately predict digits from 0 to 9 after training on the extensive MNIST dataset. A comprehensive analysis of the code and prediction results is available in the PDF attached to this repository.  </p>
